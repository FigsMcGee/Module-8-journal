If i were to pick one part of this evaluation that I would revise, it would be all things related to the linux systems. my lack of experience with the platform means that all my research is second hand knowledge, and i would like to get first hand experience for next time.
With regards to making the program and taking into account on the developers needs, I focused on the feasability and potential gain of each platform weighed against the effort it would take to gain an audience on that platform, combined with other obstacles such as the IOS appstore having a large licensing fee in order to legally platform an app on apple phones. Things such as the workload required to get the app working on certain platforms and potential crossplay were also things i took into account
